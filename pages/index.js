        Welcome to the TicketSwap challenger. The goal of this challenger is to
        finish the todo list stated below ‚òëÔ∏è
      </Description>

      <StyledCollapsible buttonLabel="Todo list">
        <List>
          <li>
            Oh ohh, guess we didn't think about mobile styling üò≥ Can you make
            it pretty?
          </li>
          <li>
            Ouch, it looks like we have some errors popping up in the console üòñ
            Could you solve them for us?
          </li>
          <li>
            You can see that there is a popular events widget on this page,
            unfortunately we couldn't get server-side rendering to work ü§î Can
            you?
          </li>
          <li>
            As you can see there are also event pages. These pages are a bit
            simple right now, could you add some more data to that page? Also
            please make sure that server-side render works there.
          </li>
          <li>
            We couldn't find the time to make a search page anymore, but it
            would definitely make the challenger better. We want to be able to
            search all the events that are in the mocked data set trough a
            graphql query. Design-wise it's up to you (hint: check our design
            system).
          </li>
          <li>
            At the moment the navigation is a nightmare, can you make sure that
            everything connects to each other correctly?
          </li>
