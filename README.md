# TicketSwap challenger ðŸš€

Thank you for doing our challenger. The goal would be to finish the todo-list stated in the challenger itself. If you have any questions you can always [contact us](mailto:rob@ticketswap.com).

## Approach

The challenger is setup in a way for you to showcase your creativity, eye for detail, UX skills and overall knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS. Inside the challenge you'll find your goals set in a to do list.

We've timeboxed this challenge for roughly _2-4_ hours. Some of these goals should be pretty straight forward. Others, such as the 'improvement' goal are completely dependend on your own imagination. It's completely up to you how far you want to take it, but keep the timebox in mind.

## Setup

First of all, you need to setup your local environment.
If you don't have [node/npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) installed yet be sure to do so.

```shell script
> git clone git@github.com:TicketSwap/challenger.git
> cd challenger
> yarn
> yarn dev
```

The server will start at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), where you can find everything you need to start with the challenger.

## Handing in the assessment

When you're finished you can send it to us in reply of the mail you got with this assessment.
