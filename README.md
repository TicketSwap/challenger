# TicketSwap challenger ðŸš€
Thank you for doing our challenger. The goal would be to finish the todo-list stated in the challenger itself. If you have any questions you can always [contact us](mailto:rob@ticketswap.com).

## Setup
First of all, you need to setup your local environment.
If you don't have [node/npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed yet be sure to do so.
```shell script
> git clone git@github.com:TicketSwap/challenger.git
> cd challenger
> yarn
> yarn dev
```
The server will start at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), where you can find everything you need to start with the challenger.

## Handing in the assessment
When you're finished you can send it to us in reply of the mail you got with this assessment.

### Good luck
And again if you have any questions, [let us know](mailto:rob@ticketswap.com)! ðŸ¤©
