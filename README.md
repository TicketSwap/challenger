# TicketSwap challenger ðŸš€

Thank you for doing our challenger. The goal would be to finish the todo-list stated in the challenger itself. If you have any questions you can always [contact us](mailto:rob@ticketswap.com).

## Approach

The challenger is setup in a way for you to showcase your creativity, eye for detail, UX skills and overall knowledge of HTML, CSS and TS/JS. Inside the challenge you'll find your goals set in a to do list. If you don't feel comfortable writing TypeScript feel free to
do the challenge in JavaScript.

We've timeboxed this challenge for roughly _4_ hours. Some of these goals should be pretty straight forward. Others, such as the 'improvement' goal are completely dependent on your own imagination. It's completely up to you how far you want to take it, but keep the timebox in mind.

## Setup

First of all, you need to setup your local environment.
If you don't have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) installed yet be sure to do so.

```shell script
> git clone git@github.com:TicketSwap/challenger.git
> cd challenger
> yarn
> yarn dev
```

The server will start at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), where you can find everything you need to start with the challenger.

## Generating Types

In this assessment you'll be working with GraphQL. We've setup a codegen for you that will generate the types for your queries and the types of the API. You can do this by running the following command:

```shell script
yarn graphql:generate-types
```

## Handing in the assessment

When you're finished you can send it to us in reply of the mail you got with this assessment or share the repo with [@glenngijsberts](https://github.com/glenngijsberts) and [@RobVermeer](https://github.com/robvermeer).

### Good luck

And again if you have any questions, [let us know](mailto:rob@ticketswap.com)! ðŸ¤©
